  Plesk is a web hosting control panel designed to help IT specialists manage web, DNS, mail, and other services through a comprehensive and user-friendly GUI. It acts as an intermediary between system services and users. For instance, when a user creates a website through the Plesk GUI, Plesk propagates this request to a web server, either Apache or IIS, which then adds a new virtual host to the system1. This method of administering all system services from a single web interface reduces maintenance costs and gives administrators more flexibility and control.
